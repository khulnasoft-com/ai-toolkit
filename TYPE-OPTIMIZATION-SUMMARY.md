# Type System Optimization Summary

## Problem

The TypeScript build was encountering a "Type instantiation is excessively deep" error in `core/generate-text/output.ts` (line 65). This occurs when TypeScript encounters deeply nested type definitions that exceed its type instantiation depth limit.

## Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive type system optimization that:

1. **Creates flattened type definitions**:

   - Introduced base interfaces (`BaseToolCall`, `BaseToolResult`)
   - Created direct mapped types instead of chained conditional types
   - Used interface extensions for "type caching"

2. **Breaks dependency chains**:

   - Separated complex conditional types into discrete steps
   - Used type intersections instead of deeply nested conditionals
   - Created pre-computed alias types to prevent redundant computation

3. **Optimizes array types**:
   - Created cached array interfaces that extend from simpler type definitions
   - Replaced direct array usage with cached interface types
   - Added specialized cached types for different contexts (Step, Output, etc.)

## Impact

These changes significantly reduce the type instantiation depth while maintaining full type safety. The TypeScript compiler now has to perform fewer recursive type evaluations, which resolves the error and might also improve compilation performance.

## Files Changed

- Created new: `tool-types.ts`, `output-types.ts`
- Modified: `tool-call.ts`, `tool-result.ts`, `generate-text-result.ts`, `step-result.ts`

## Type Relationships

- Original: `ToolResultArray<TOOLS> = Array<ToolResultUnion<ToToolResultObject<ToToolsWithDefinedExecute<ToToolsWithExecute<TOOLS>>>>>` (deeply nested)
- New: `ToolResultArray<TOOLS> = ToolResultArrayCache<TOOLS>` (flattened with interface caching)

This approach follows TypeScript best practices for handling complex type systems with deep generic nesting.
